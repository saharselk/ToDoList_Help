//** This file contains all the code for Core Data (Iteration 2)**

import CoreData

//In Iteration 2, copy and Paste PersistenceController struct code here
    //Make sure to change the name passed to the NSPersistentContainer to the name of your project (capital letters, spaces, and all).

//Later in Iteration 2, between the struct and the body of the code you pasted, add the let statement that allows the rest of your project to access the Core Data file
